    "This collection of [jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) notebooks introduces various topics of [Digital Signal Processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_signal_processing). The theory is accompanied by computational examples written in [IPython 3](http://ipython.org/). The notebooks constitute the lecture notes to the masters course Digital Signal Processing read by Sascha Spors, Institute of Communications Engineering, Universität Rostock. The sources of the notebooks, as well as installation and usage instructions can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/spatialaudio/digital-signal-processing-lecture)."
