    "## Design of Non-Recursive Filters using the Window Method\n",
    "\n",
    "The design of non-recursive filters with a finite-length impulse response (FIR) is a frequent task in practical applications. The designed filter should approximate a prescribed frequency response as close as possible. First, the design of causal filters is considered. For many applications the resulting filter should have a linear phase characteristic since this results in a constant (frequency independent) group delay. We therefore specialize the design to causal linear-phase filters in a second step."

The [Paley-Wiener theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paley%E2%80%93Wiener_theorem) states, that the transfer function of a causal system may only have zeros at a countable number of single frequencies. This is not the case for idealized filters, like e.g. the [ideal low-pass filter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-pass_filter#Ideal_and_real_filters), were the transfer function is zeros over an interval of frequencies. The basic idea of the window method is to truncate the impulse response $h_\\text{d}[k]$ in order to derive a causal FIR filter. This can be achieved by applying a window $w[k]$ of finite length $N$ to $h_\\text{d}[k]$\n",

The rectangular window features a narrow main lobe at the cost of relative high sidelobe level. The main lobe gets narrower with increasing length $N$. The convolution of the desired frequency response with the frequency response of the window function effectively results in smoothing and ringing. While the main lobe will smooth discontinuities of the desired transfer function, the sidelobes result in undesirable ringing effects. The latter can be alleviated by using other window functions. Note that typical [window functions](../spectral_analysis_deterministic_signals/window_functions.ipynb) decay towards their ends and are symmetric with respect to their center. This may cause problems for desired impulse responses with large magnitudes towards their ends."
