Increasing the length `N` of the filter does not improve the attenuation in the stop-band, it only changes the frequencies of the local minima of the ripples. The reason for the poor performance of the designed filter is the zero-phase of the desired transfer function which cannot be realized by a causal non-recursive system.

    "Solution: Comparison of above results to the window method (with a rectangular window) reveals that both provide a similar performance in terms of achievable stop-band attenuation. Increasing `M` in above example does not result in obvious changes since the initial choice constitutes already a high amount of oversampling. However, decreasing `M` till it is the range of the filter length `N` results in a smooth degradation of the performance towards the original (not oversampled) frequency sampling method."
