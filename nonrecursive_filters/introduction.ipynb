    "\n",
    "Two aspects of this representation become evident when inspecting above equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The output signal $y[k]$ is a linear combination of the input signal $x[k]$. There is no feedback of the output signal of past time-instants. Therefore, such filters are termed as *non-recursive* filters.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. In order to compute the output signal at one particular time-instant $k$, the input signal needs to be known for all past and future time-instants.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second aspect prohibits a practical realization. In order to be able to realize a non-recursive filter by convolution, the output at time-instant $k$ should only depend on the input signal $x[k]$ up to time-index $k$\n",

    "### Finite Impulse Response\n",
    "\n",
    "Many practical systems have an impulse response of finite length $N$ or can be approximated by an impulse response of finite length\n",

    "The evaluation of the convolution for a FIR of length $N$ requires $N$ multiplications and $N-1$ additions per time index $k$. For the real-time convolution of an audio signal with a sampling rate of $f_\\text{S} = 48$ kHz with a FIR of length $N = 48000$ we have to compute around $2 \\times 2.3 \\cdot 10^9$ numerical operations per second. This is a considerable numerical complexity, especially on embedded or mobile platforms. Therefore, various techniques have been developed to lower the computational complexity."
